# Enhancing Text-to-3D Generation: A Multi-View Diffusion and Trajectory Consistency Approach

In the realm of digital content creation and 3D interaction, text-to-3D generation has emerged as a pivotal technology. Traditional methods often struggle with complex geometric structures and multi-view inconsistencies. This paper introduces a Multi-View Diffusion-Guided Trajectory Consistency Optimization (MV-TCO) framework to address these challenges. By integrating MVDream with a 3D-aware module for initialization and employing a multi-step trajectory optimization strategy, MV-TCO enhances geometric detail representation and cross-view consistency. Experiments demonstrate that MV-TCO outperforms existing methods in CLIP scores and user perceptual evaluations, reducing training time to approximately 45 minutes on an RTX4090 GPU without compromising quality. These results underscore MV-TCO's potential as an efficient and scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-3D generation.
